CamFIN Features
===================
When CamFIN has been developed to a mature state it should support the following features.

#. Forward solution of time dependant cardiac mechanics problems including both passive and active effects.
	
#. Adjoint solution of time dependant cardiac mechanics problems.
		
#. Logging to terminal during runtime with the option of saving the log afterwards and support for various log levels.

#. Classes to support flexbile and interchangeable problem specifications (BC, initial conditions, material parameters etc...)

#. Mesh input for meshes with numbered regions for the definition of measures in DOLFIN.
   
Future feature will be 

#. Support for multi-physics, including electrophysiology and fluid modelling.

#. Support for fixed-point and Newton schemes using a combination of models.
